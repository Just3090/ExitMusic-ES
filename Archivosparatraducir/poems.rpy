It happened in the dead of night while I was slicing bread for a guilty snack.
My attention was caught by the scuttering of a raccoon outside my window.
That was, I believe, the first time I noticed my strange tendencies as an unordinary human.
I gave the raccoon a piece of bread, my subconscious well aware of the consequences.
Well aware that a raccoon that is fed will always come back for more.
The enticing beauty of my cutting knife was the symptom.
The bread, my hungry curiosity.
The raccoon, an urge.

The moon increments its phase and reflects that much more light off of my cutting knife.
The very same light that glistens in the eyes of my raccoon friend.
I slice the bread, fresh and soft. The raccoon becomes excited.
Or perhaps I'm merely projecting my emotions onto the newly-satisfied animal.

The raccoon has taken to following me.
You could say that we've gotten quite used to each other.
The raccoon becomes hungry more and more frequently, so my bread is always handy.
Every time I brandish my cutting knife, the raccoon shows me its excitement.
A rush of blood. Classic Pavlovian conditioning. I slice the bread.
And I feed myself again."""

A marvel millions of years in the making.
Where the womb of Earth chaotically meets the surface.
Under a clear blue sky, an expanse of bliss--
But beneath gray rolling clouds, an endless enigma.
The easiest world to get lost in
Is one where everything can be found.

One can only build a sand castle where the sand is wet.
But where the sand is wet, the tide comes.
Will it gently lick at your foundations until you give in?
Or will a sudden wave send you crashing down in the blink of an eye?
Either way, the outcome is the same.
Yet we still build sand castles.

I stand where the foam wraps around my ankles.
Where my toes squish into the sand.
The salty air is therapeutic.
The breeze is gentle, yet powerful.
I sink my toes into the ultimate boundary line, tempted by the foamy tendrils.
Turn back, and I abandon my peace to erode at the shore.
Drift forward, and I return to Earth forevermore."""

I open my umbrella, casting a shadow to shield me from visibility.
But I am too late.
He steps into the streetlight. I gasp and drop my umbrella.
The light flickers. My heart pounds. He raises his arm.

Time stops.

The only indication of movement is the amber light flickering against his outstretched arm.
The flickering light is in rhythm with the pounding of my heart.
Teasing me for succumbing to this forbidden emotion.

Giving up on understanding, I laugh.
Understanding is overrated.

Allí estábamos juntos,
en una habitación blanca con ventana,
por donde entraba la luz del sol.
Daba igual el final,
daba igual el precio.
Yo solo quería lo mejor para ti.

Tus manitas,
tu sonrisa de gatito travieso...
Todo era perfecto,
aunque solo fuese por un rato.
Pero todo se vino abajo,
porque tuviste que irte.

Y ahora que ya no estás,
no queda nada.
No hice lo que debía,
y lo estamos pagando.
Una sombra se cierne sobre mí,
y no hay dónde esconderse.

En mi mente y en mi pecho
queda un eco sordo,
un silencio que grita
que tú ya no estás.
Todo esto ha sido culpa mía.
¿Cómo he podido dejar que pasara?

La culpa me aprieta como un fantasma,
el remordimiento me arrastra como una tormenta.
Hay una voz,
una llamada...
A la que no puedo resistirme.
En mi hora oscura,
que pase lo que tenga que pasar...

He destrozado todo.
No soporto escuchar
los gritos de mi conciencia.
Me destrozan la cabeza.
Corro al fondo de mí mismo
intentando taparme los oídos.
Pero es el ruido más fuerte que jamás he oído.

Quizá sumergirme a fondo,
enfrentar mis miedos,
me devuelva hasta ti.
Dos metros bajo la superficie
aún puedo ver tu cara, ondulante.
Y si pudiera alcanzarte,
quizá pudiera salir de aquí.

(Él no se creía que fuese tan fácil.)
(Corrió y dio un salto de fé.)
(¡Splash!)
(Los problemas tienen solución, ¿sabes?)
(Una vida entera llena de putas mierdas...)
(Arreglada en un solo golpe.)
\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
Te veré en la próxima vida."""
